Kubernetes' users often set the replicas based on empirical values when creating application resources. Based on the replicas recommendation, you can analyze the actual application usage and recommend a more suitable replicas configuration. You can use it to improve the resource utilization of the cluster.

## Motivation

Kubernetes workload replicas allows you to control the Pods for quick scaling. However, how to set a reasonable replicas has always been a problem for application administrators. Too large may lead to a lot of waste of resources, while too low may cause stability problems.

The HPA in community provides a dynamic autoscaling mechanism based on realtime metrics, meanwhile Crane's EffectiveHPA supports prediction-driven autoscaling based on HPA. However, in the real world, only some workloads can scale horizontally all the time, many workloads require a fixed number of pods.

The figure below shows a workload with low utilization, it has 30% of the resource wasted between the Pod's peak historical usage and its Request.

Replica recommendation attempts to reduce the complexity of how to know the replicas of workloads by analyzing the historical usage.

## Sample

A Replicas recommendation sample yaml looks like below:

```yaml
kind: Recommendation
apiVersion: analysis.crane.io/v1alpha1
metadata:
  name: workloads-rule-replicas-p84jv
  namespace: kube-system
  labels:
    addonmanager.kubernetes.io/mode: Reconcile
    analysis.crane.io/recommendation-rule-name: workloads-rule
    analysis.crane.io/recommendation-rule-recommender: Replicas
    analysis.crane.io/recommendation-rule-uid: 18588495-f325-4873-b45a-7acfe9f1ba94
    k8s-app: kube-dns
    kubernetes.io/cluster-service: 'true'
    kubernetes.io/name: CoreDNS
  ownerReferences:
    - apiVersion: analysis.crane.io/v1alpha1
      kind: RecommendationRule
      name: workloads-rule
      uid: 18588495-f325-4873-b45a-7acfe9f1ba94
      controller: false
      blockOwnerDeletion: false
spec:
  targetRef:
    kind: Deployment
    namespace: kube-system
    name: coredns
    apiVersion: apps/v1
  type: Replicas
  completionStrategy:
    completionStrategyType: Once
  adoptionType: StatusAndAnnotation
status:
  recommendedValue:
    replicasRecommendation:
      replicas: 1
  targetRef: { }
  recommendedInfo: '{"spec":{"replicas":1}}'
  currentInfo: '{"spec":{"replicas":2}}'
  action: Patch
  conditions:
    - type: Ready
      status: 'True'
      lastTransitionTime: '2022-11-28T08:07:36Z'
      reason: RecommendationReady
      message: Recommendation is ready
  lastUpdateTime: '2022-11-29T11:07:45Z'
```

In this sample：

- Recommendation TargetRef point to a Deployment in kube-system namespace：coredns
- Recommendation type is Replicas
- adoptionType is StatusAndAnnotation，indicated that put recommendation result in recommendation.status and Deployment 的 Annotation
- recommendedInfo shows the recommended replicas（recommendedValue is deprecated），currentInfo shows the current replicas.The format is Json that can be updated for TargetRef by `Kubectl Patch`
  TargetRef

## Implement

The process for one Replicas recommendation:

1. Query the historical CPU and Memory usage of the Workload for the past week by monitoring system.
2. Use DSP algorithm to predict the CPU usage in the future.
3. Calculate the replicas for both CPU and memory, then choose a larger one.

### Algorithm 

Use cpu usage as an example. Assume that the P99 of the historical CPU usage of the workload is 10 cores, the Pod CPU Request is 5 cores, and the target peak utilization is 50%. Therefore, we know that 4(10 / 50% / 5) pods can meet the target peak utilization.

```go
    replicas := int32(math.Ceil(workloadUsage / (TargetUtilization * float64(requestTotal))))
```

### Abnormal workloads

The following types of abnormal workloads are not recommended:

1. workload with low replicas: If the replicas is too low, it may not have high recommendation demand. Associated configuration: 'workload-min-replicas'
2. There is a certain percentage of the not running pods for workload: if the Pod of workload mostly can't run normally, may not be suitable for recommendation, associated configuration: `pod-min-ready-seconds` | `pod-available-ratio`

### Prometheus Metrics

Record recommended replicas to Metric: crane_analytics_replicas_recommendation

## How to verify the accuracy of recommendation results

Users can get the Workload resource usage through the following Prom-query, when you get the workload usage, put it into the algorithm above.

Taking Deployment Craned in crane-system as an example, you can use your container, namespace to replace it in following Prom-query.

```shell
sum(irate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{namespace="crane-system",pod=~"^craned-.*$",container!=""}[3m]))  # cpu usage
```

```shell
sum(container_memory_working_set_bytes{namespace="crane-system",pod=~"^craned-.*$",container!=""})  # memory usage
```

## Accepted resources

Support StatefulSet and Deployment by default，but all workloads that support `Scale SubResource` are supported.
