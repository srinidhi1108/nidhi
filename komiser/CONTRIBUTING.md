We are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to process them as fast as possible. Not sure if that typo is worth a pull request? Do it! We will appreciate it.

`Note: If your pull request is not accepted on the first try, don’t be discouraged! If there’s a problem with the implementation, hopefully you received feedback on what to improve.`

## Guidelines 

We recommend discussing your plans on our Discord (join our <a href="https://discord.oraculi.io/">community server</a>) head to the `contributors` section before starting to code - especially for more ambitious contributions. This gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give feedback on your design, and maybe point out if someone else is working on the same thing.

Any significant improvements should be documented as a github issue before anybody starts working on it. Please take a moment to check that an issue doesn’t already exist documenting your bug report or improvement proposal. If it does, it never hurts to add a quick “+1” or “I have this problem too”. This will help prioritize the most common problems and requests

Feel free to communicate through the `#feedback` and `#feature-request` Discord channels. If we identify you as a `contributor`, we will add you to a private `#contributors` channel, to expedite internal communication (Hope to see you there!).

## Conventions

Fork the repo and make changes on your fork in a feature branch based on the master branch:

- If it’s a bugfix branch, name it fix/XXX-something where XXX is the number of the issue
- If it’s a feature branch, create an enhancement issue to announce your intentions, and name it feature/XXX-something where XXX is the number of the issue.
- Submit unit tests for your changes. Go has a great test framework built in; use it! Take a look at existing tests for inspiration. Run the full test suite on your branch before submitting a pull request.
- Make sure you include relevant updates or additions to documentation when creating or modifying features.
- Write clean code. Universally formatted code promotes ease of writing, reading, and maintenance. Always run go fmt before committing your changes. Most editors have plugins that do this automatically.

## How to add a new cloud provider?

1. Create a `provider.go` under `providers/provider` folder with the following content:

```go
package aws

import (
	"context"
	"log"

	. "github.com/mlabouardy/komiser/providers"
	"github.com/uptrace/bun"
)

func listOfSupportedServices() []FetchDataFunction {
	return []FetchDataFunction{}
}

func FetchProviderData(ctx context.Context, client ProviderClient, db *bun.DB) {
	for _, function := range listOfSupportedServices() {
		resources, err := function(ctx, client)
		if err != nil {
			log.Printf("[%s][PROVIDER] %s", client.Name, err)
		} else {
			for _, resource := range resources {
				db.NewInsert().Model(&resource).Exec(context.Background())
			}
		}
	}
}
```

2. Add provider SDK client in `providers/providers.go`
3. Include provider configuration in TOML format under `config.toml`

## How to add a new cloud service/resource?

The process to follow for adding a new cloud service is:

1. Create a new folder under the `providers/providername/service` path called `servicename.go`
2. Inside the new file, add the following:

```go
package service

import (
	"context"
	"log"
	"time"

	. "github.com/mlabouardy/komiser/models"
	. "github.com/mlabouardy/komiser/providers"
)

func MyServiceResources(ctx context.Context, client ProviderClient) ([]Resource, error) {
	resources := make([]Resource, 0)
	
    // Logic goes here

	log.Printf("[%s] Fetched %d CLOUD PROVIDER NAME resources\n", client.Name, len(resources))
	return resources, nil
}
```

3. Call the function from `providers/providername/providername.go` by adding `MyServiceResources()` to `listOfSupportedServices()` function.

## General tips

A few important things to note when adding functions that call the cloud provider API:

- If possible, always use an API call that allows you to fetch many resources at once
- Take pagination into account. Ensure you fetch all the resources.
- Make sure the resource has a tags JSON column (if possible). Sometimes this requires additional SDK calls.
- Code is required to be formatted using gofmt, this covers most code style requirements. It is also highly recommended to use goimports to automatically order imports.
- Please try to keep lines length under 80 characters, the exact number of characters is not strict but it generally helps with readability.
